Below is a detailed **development plan** to build a portable, server-based application that interacts with the Redtrack API (an attribution tracking software, as per their docs at https://api.redtrack.io/docs/index.html). The server will be hosted exclusively on Railway (a cloud platform for deploying apps), with **no local files** involved—all configuration will be handled via code, environment variables (env vars), and Railway's built-in features. This ensures portability: you can deploy, manage, and access it from any device with a browser or API client (e.g., curl, Postman, or an IDE like VS Code).

I'll interpret "model context protocol" as a system for providing structured context data (e.g., an array of tracking parameters, attribution data, or API responses) that can be fed into an AI model's context settings in an IDE (e.g., for tools like GitHub Copilot, Claude in Anthropic's IDE, or custom LLM integrations in VS Code). The server will expose an API endpoint that generates and returns a JSON array (e.g., `[{ "key": "value", ... }]`) based on Redtrack data. This array can be copied/pasted or programmatically imported into your IDE's model context settings for tasks like code generation, analytics, or attribution-aware development.

The plan assumes basic knowledge of web development (e.g., Node.js). If you need code snippets or adjustments, let me know.

### Assumptions and Prerequisites
- **Redtrack API Access**: You'll need a Redtrack account and API key (from their dashboard). Store it as an env var (never in code).
- **Tech Stack**: We'll use Node.js with Express.js for the server (lightweight, Railway-friendly). Alternatives: Python (Flask) if preferred.
- **Portability**: No local files means:
  - All code in a Git repo.
  - Secrets (e.g., API key) as Railway env vars.
  - Data fetched dynamically from Redtrack API—no static storage.
- **Output**: The server will have a single endpoint (e.g., `/generate-context`) that returns a JSON array like:
  ```
  [
    { "campaignId": "123", "attributionType": "last-click", "metrics": { "clicks": 100, "conversions": 20 } },
    { "campaignId": "456", "attributionType": "multi-touch", "metrics": { "clicks": 150, "conversions": 30 } }
  ]
  ```
  This can be used in IDE settings (e.g., paste into a config file for model context in VS Code's AI extensions).
- **Cost/Security**: Railway has a free tier. Use HTTPS (Railway provides it). Secure the endpoint with a token if needed.
- **Tools Needed**: Git, Node.js (for local testing, but deployment is cloud-only), a browser/IDE for access.

### Step-by-Step Development Plan

#### Step 1: Project Setup (Local Planning, No Local Files in Final Deployment)
- **Goal**: Create a minimal codebase that can be deployed directly to Railway.
- **Actions**:
  1. Create a new Git repository on GitHub (or similar). This will be your "source of truth"—no local files needed beyond cloning for edits.
  2. In the repo, add these files (all code-based, no data files):
     - `server.js` (main Node.js file).
     - `package.json` (for dependencies).
     - `.gitignore` (ignore `node_modules`).
  3. Install dependencies via `package.json` (run `npm init -y` locally once, then commit):
     ```
     {
       "name": "redtrack-context-server",
       "version": "1.0.0",
       "main": "server.js",
       "scripts": {
         "start": "node server.js"
       },
       "dependencies": {
         "express": "^4.18.2",
         "axios": "^1.4.0"  // For API calls to Redtrack
       }
     }
     ```
  4. Write the core server logic in `server.js` (example below). It will:
     - Fetch data from Redtrack API (e.g., campaigns or reports endpoint).
     - Transform it into a context array (customize based on your needs, e.g., attribution metrics).
     - Expose via HTTP endpoint.
     ```javascript
     const express = require('express');
     const axios = require('axios');
     const app = express();
     const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;  // Railway sets PORT

     // Env vars (set in Railway dashboard, not here)
     const REDTRACK_API_KEY = process.env.REDTRACK_API_KEY;
     const REDTRACK_API_BASE = 'https://api.redtrack.io/v1';

     app.get('/generate-context', async (req, res) => {
       if (!REDTRACK_API_KEY) {
         return res.status(500).json({ error: 'API key missing' });
       }

       try {
         // Example: Fetch campaigns from Redtrack API (adapt from docs)
         const response = await axios.get(`${REDTRACK_API_BASE}/campaigns`, {
           headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${REDTRACK_API_KEY}` }
         });

         // Transform into model context array (e.g., attribution data)
         const contextArray = response.data.map(campaign => ({
           campaignId: campaign.id,
           attributionType: campaign.attribution_model || 'last-click',  // From Redtrack docs
           metrics: {
             clicks: campaign.clicks,
             conversions: campaign.conversions
           },
           // Add more fields as needed for your model's context
         }));

         res.json(contextArray);  // Returns the array for IDE use
       } catch (error) {
         res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to fetch from Redtrack', details: error.message });
       }
     });

     app.listen(port, () => {
       console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
     });
     ```
     - Customize the API call: Refer to Redtrack docs (e.g., `/reports`, `/conversions`) for endpoints. Add query params via `req.query` for flexibility (e.g., `?dateFrom=2023-01-01`).

- **Time Estimate**: 1-2 hours.
- **Testing Locally (Optional)**: Run `npm install && npm start` on your device for quick tests. But remember: final use is cloud-only—no local persistence.

#### Step 2: Deployment to Railway (Cloud-Only Hosting)
- **Goal**: Host the server on Railway for portability—access from any device via URL.
- **Actions**:
  1. Sign up for Railway (free tier suffices for this).
  2. In Railway dashboard: Create a new project > Link your GitHub repo > Select the branch.
  3. Railway auto-detects Node.js and deploys (it runs `npm install` and `npm start`).
  4. Add env vars in Railway dashboard (under "Variables"):
     - `REDTRACK_API_KEY`: Your Redtrack API key.
     - (Optional) `AUTH_TOKEN`: For securing the endpoint (add logic in code to check `req.headers.authorization`).
  5. Deploy: Railway builds and hosts it. You'll get a public URL like `https://your-app.railway.app`.
  6. Configure domain/HTTPS: Railway provides free SSL and a subdomain.
  7. Set up auto-deploys: Link GitHub so pushes to main auto-redeploy.

- **Portability Notes**:
  - Access from any device: Hit `https://your-app.railway.app/generate-context` in a browser or IDE (e.g., via fetch in VS Code scripts).
  - No local files: Everything runs in Railway's containers—code from Git, secrets from env vars.
  - Scaling: Railway handles traffic; add a database service if you need caching (but avoid for pure portability).

- **Time Estimate**: 30-60 minutes (mostly Railway setup).

#### Step 3: Integration with IDE Model Context Protocol Settings
- **Goal**: Make the output array usable in an IDE for "model context protocol" (e.g., feeding attribution data into AI model prompts/settings).
- **Actions**:
  1. In your IDE (e.g., VS Code):
     - Install an extension like "REST Client" or "Thunder Client" to call the endpoint.
     - Or write a simple script (e.g., in a `.js` or `.py` file) to fetch and log the array:
       ```javascript
       // Example VS Code script (run with Node.js extension)
       const axios = require('axios');
       axios.get('https://your-app.railway.app/generate-context')
         .then(response => console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data)));  // Copy this array
       ```
     - Paste the array into your model's context settings (e.g., in Claude/Anthropic IDE: add to `context.json`; in Copilot: use as prompt context).
  2. Customize the array: In `server.js`, add query params (e.g., `/generate-context?filter=conversions`) to tailor output for specific IDE use cases (e.g., generate context for code reviews based on attribution metrics).
  3. If your "model context protocol" is a specific framework (e.g., for LLMs), extend the array with metadata like `{ "protocolVersion": "1.0", "data": [...] }`.

- **Time Estimate**: 30 minutes.

#### Step 4: Security, Monitoring, and Maintenance
- **Security**:
  - Use env vars for secrets—never commit them.
  - Add rate limiting (e.g., via `express-rate-limit` package) to prevent abuse.
  - If public, require an auth token in requests.
- **Monitoring**:
  - Railway provides logs and metrics—monitor API calls and errors.
  - Add error handling in code (e.g., retry on Redtrack API failures).
- **Updates**:
  - Edit code in Git, push to repo—Railway auto-deploys.
  - Scale if needed (Railway supports horizontal scaling).
- **Portability Check**: Test on multiple devices (e.g., phone browser, laptop IDE)—it should work without setup.

- **Time Estimate**: 30 minutes initial; ongoing as needed.

#### Potential Challenges and Solutions
- **Redtrack API Limits**: Check rate limits in docs; add caching if needed (use Railway's Redis service, but keep it optional for portability).
- **Errors**: If API calls fail, the server returns a JSON error—handle in your IDE script.
- **Cost**: Free for low usage; monitor Railway credits.
- **Extensions**: If you need more features (e.g., WebSocket for real-time context), add them later.

#### Total Time Estimate and Next Steps
- **Total Time**: 3-5 hours for initial build/deploy.
- **Next Steps**: Clone the repo, deploy to Railway, and test the endpoint. If you share more details (e.g., specific Redtrack endpoint or IDE), I can refine the code. For a full repo example, search GitHub for "node express railway" and adapt. Let me know if you need help with Python instead!
